# COVID
For this research project, I will be conducting an analysis of COVID-19 sequences that have been sourced from the GISAID database.
Specifically, my focus will be on data that pertains to the former Soviet Union countries. 
All of the necessary data has been obtained from GISAID, and 
I have implemented several filters such as geography, completeness, 
low coverage exclusion, and collection date completeness to ensure the quality and relevance of the data being used. 
Then phylogenetic trees, including a consensus tree were constructed to derive further conclusions about the spread of this virus. 
The code from this notebook can be further adjusted to build a pipeline in .py file.

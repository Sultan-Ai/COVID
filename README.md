# COVID
For that research project, I conducted an analysis of COVID-19 sequences that were sourced from the GISAID database. Specifically, my focus was on data that pertained to the former Soviet Union countries. All of the necessary data had been obtained from GISAID, and I had implemented several filters such as geography, completeness, low coverage exclusion, and collection date completeness to ensure the quality and relevance of the data being used. Then phylogenetic trees, including a consensus tree, were constructed to derive further conclusions about the spread of this virus. The code from this notebook could be further adjusted to build a pipeline in .py file. This project used Biopython. This work showcased common work that I did in bioscience.
